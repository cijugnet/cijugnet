# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project for CIJUG

This hosts our CDK files for managing AWS Resources such as the S3 bucket.

`bin/cdk.ts` initializes the CDK project and creates a cdk-stack

`lib/cdk-stack` creates the S3 bucket along with a bucket policy and uploades the HTML files, CloudFront distribution, R53 records, etc.



We have all CDK commands hosted in the Github workflow which runs dependind on triggers at the top of the workflow file.

`cdk bootstrap` initializes and configures the AWS CDK environment which we deploy serivices to

`cdk diff` provides differences between the currently deployed stack and the current local CDK files

`cdk synth` creates a CloudFormation template of all the resources in CDK files

`cdk deploy` deployes the template with resources to AWS
